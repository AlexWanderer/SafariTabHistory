SafariTabHistory
================


This extension adds a tab history that goes back more than the standard single tab that Safari stores. It adds a context menu to open the last clased tab and also the keyboard shortcut Command + Shift + T to match other popular browsers. Note that due to limitations of Safari (or perhaps I just cant find the proper documentation) only the tab URL is restored. The tabs history is gone forever.



Usage
---
- Command + Shift + T
- "Open Last Closed Tab" will also appear in the context menu when there are tabs on the stack
